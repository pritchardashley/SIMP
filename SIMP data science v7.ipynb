    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everywhere we go, campus, a park, or even a big city, there will be squirrels. There are over 280 species of squirrels around the world (4) and come in a variety of colors: Black, brown, grey, red, and even containing purple, orange, and maroon (1) Research has found that squirrels have personalities and similar behaviors to humans (3). There has also been some research into the patterns of dominance in squirrels with older squirrels being more aggressive than younger squirrels and similar patterns for larger and smaller squirrels (6). There is a lot more to learn about squirrels and how and why they behave the ways that they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of our interest on this topic stems from our personal observations, specifically with the squirrels on the University of Utah campus. We as a group concluded that the level of human interactions, and food availability may have impacted their behaviors in certain situations. The squirrels on the University of Utah campus even have their own portion of the University of Utah website dedicated to them (2) as well as an annual “Squirrel Fest” held by the Natural History Museum (5). Although the data set of squirrels that we will be using is not based in Utah, we feel as though we can learn a lot of information, through the application of skills learned in class, to gain a better understanding of the squirrels in Utah and around the world. \n"

    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary question that we want to try to answer within our project is if there is a strong correlation between the physical characteristics and location of the squirrels in central park and their observed behaviors. The specific characteristics that we are focusing on are fur color, highlighted fur color, age, and location of the squirrels. In a part of this we want to see if the squirrels that show fear towards interactions with humans have different characteristics than those squirrels that do not. Our null hypothesis is that the physical characteristics have no effect on behavioral observations and our alternative hypothesis is that the physical characteristics have an effect on the observed behaviors. \t\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Our learning objective is to utilize what we have learned in class to perform an accurate analysis of our data. Potential skills we hope to apply and understand more deeply include but are not limited to: R-squared, P-value, OLS Regression, descriptive statistics, categorical data, dummy values, data clean, and data visualization. Another thing we want to look into is creating a map of the squirrels in Central Park that shows our results for better visualization.\n"

    "Our data comes from the 2018 NYC Squirrel Census. This was a citizen science project that had volunteers observing squirrels in Central Park in New York City. The data is in two CSV files, as well as a word document with data definitions. The first file has our primary data, which includes 3022 observations. Each observation has 7 columns identifying the location, time, date, etc for the observation. There are 23 different columns with boolean or nominal values for different attributes of the observed squirrel, such as color (grey, cinnamon or black), what the squirrel was doing(eating, foraging, etc.), and behaviors it displayed, including vocalizations or interactions with humans. The second file is a CSV containing the latitude and longitude of the hectares that the park was broken into for the observations. \n",

If people are influenced to interact with the squirrels it could also lead to the transmission of disease between the squirrels and humans. With a possible influx of people interacting with squirrels this would also mean a direct increase of people to central park. This could affect other aspects of the park outside of the squirrel population like people straying off paths or stepping on plants. \n"

The first map shows the squirrel locations based on primary fur color and also outlines the hectares. The map allows the user to hover over a squirrel and see the squirrel ID associated with that specific squirrel. The second map shows us the hecatres based on how many squirrels show fear within them. The green squares mean the fear rate is lower than 50% and the red squares indicate the fear rate within that hectare is greater than 50%. The second map also shows us the squirrel locations but grouped based on if they showed fear(indicated by the scared face), or if they expressed a lack of fear (indicated by the happy face)."

    "Our project aimed to determine if there is a strong correlation between physical characteristics, including primary fur color, and age, as well as location of the squirrel within Central Park and their behaviors. While we were hopeful to find some correlation between squirrels who do show fear behavior and a common denominator to group them, our analysis did not show this. We were able to show that squirrels were not randomly distributed across the park, and were instead clustered. Through our analysis we were able to determine that different hectares squirrels are in, affects the squirrels behavior. However we were unable to determine the location of the hectares that resulted in a discrepancy of behaviors.  \n",
    "An issue we frequently ran into was discrepancies within our datasets. For example, we had two datasets for the hectares, one describing the location and the other describing the conditions of that hectare, and the two datasets did not contain the same ID numbers for the same hectares so we had to manually identify each one using their coordinates. The next discrepancy we discovered was the possibility of duplicated squirrels within our dataset due to the census being collected over multiple days. Another thing we noticed within the hectare data was there were multiple volunteers inputting conflicting data regarding the conditions of the same hectare. The next issue we ran into was utilizing Github. Since we split the coding up between the three of us we were excited to be able to all work on the same jupyter notebook and then push it to our github for the other team members to see. While this worked for the first couple of pushes, once we decided to make our own branches to avoid writing over other member’s code, somewhere along the way we broke it and we were no longer able to push or pull anything.\n",
    "For future analysis we would want to look more into the clusters that we found and see what factor is clustering the squirrels. We would also want to focus more on our hectare data by focusing on individual hectares so we have a smaller area to investigate. Another thing we discussed as a group was collecting better data from a different, more organized source, or potentially seeing if there is any consistency of behaviors across squirrels in different parks, or areas.\n"
